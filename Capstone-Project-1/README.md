Springboard Capstone Project 1: Predicting Overdose Risk from Opioid Prescriptions

This repository contains the different sections of this capstone project, including:

1) Data Wrangling
2) Data Visualizations
3) Inferential Statistics
4) Machine Learning
5) Final Project Files
6) Intermediate code used for reference to specific problems encountered throughout the project

The Final Project folder includes the code for the entire project, as well as a slide deck and written report.

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict risk of opioid overdose given a variety of background factors, including location, race, age, and sex.
